## Complex Example

Here's a complex example combining multiple features:

### Project Tasks

1. **Phase 1: Planning**
   - [x] Define requirements
   - [x] Create design document
   - [ ] Review with team
2. **Phase 2: Development**

   - [ ] Implement core features
     - [x] Text formatting
     - [x] Math support ($E=mc^2$)
     - [x] List handling
     - [ ] Image support
   - [ ] Write tests
   - [ ] Code review

3. **Phase 3: Testing**
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Implementation Formula

The complexity estimation uses: $C = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot t_i$ where $w_i$ is the weight and $t_i$ is the time for task $i$.
